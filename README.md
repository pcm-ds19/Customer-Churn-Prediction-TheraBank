# Customer Churn Prediction – Thera Bank

Machine Learning Project (PGP-DSBA | Great Lakes & Texas McCombs)

##  Project Overview
Predicted customer churn for Thera Bank’s credit card services using machine learning classification models. Applied sampling techniques (oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE) and Gradient Boosting for high recall and balanced performance.

##  Key Highlights
- Explored customer demographics and transaction behavior.
- Built multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).
- Tuned hyperparameters to optimize recall and F1-score.
- Selected **Gradient Boosting** as the final model with:
  - Accuracy = 96.4%  
  - Recall = 99.0%  
  - Precision = 96.8%  
  - F1 Score = 97.9%

##  Tools & Libraries
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | Matplotlib | Seaborn

##  Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (`ML2_Project.ipynb`)
- Business Report (`ML-2 (Project Business Report).pdf`)

##  Business Insights
- High credit utilization and low transaction frequency strongly indicate churn.
- Retention strategies should target new and younger customers.
- Proactive engagement, loyalty programs, and personalized offers can improve retention.
